This Flutter app displays a list of products with details like an image, title, description, and price.

The app consists of multiple components:

ProductApp (main.dart):
This is the main entry point of the application. It wraps the app inside the MaterialApp and sets the home screen to ProductListScreen. It also sets the app theme.

ProductListScreen:
Displays a list of products using a ListView.builder(). Each product is represented by a ProductTile widget that shows basic information (title, description, price, and image). When tapped, it navigates to the ProductDetailScreen.

ProductTile:
Displays individual product information within a card layout. It shows a productâ€™s image, title, description, and price. Tapping a tile navigates the user to a detailed view of the product (ProductDetailScreen).

ProductDetailScreen:
Shows detailed information about a single product. The screen includes a large image, the product's title, price, and description.

Product model:
A data class that defines the properties of a product: id, title, description, price, and imageUrl.
